    "When an LLM needs to run code on your behalf, the standard advice is to sandbox it in a container. The problem is that the whole reason you want the LLM running code is so it can interact with your environment -- your files, your libraries, your running processes, your data. A containerised sandbox either can't access any of that, or it requires complex volume mounts and dependency mirroring that recreate your environment inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could just `exec` the LLM's code directly in your process, which would give full access to everything... but \"everything\" includes `shutil.rmtree`, `os.remove`, `subprocess.run(\"rm -rf /\")`, etc!\n",
    "\n",
    "safepyrun takes a middle path. It runs the LLM's code in your real Python process, with access to your real objects, but interposes an allowlist that controls which callables are accessible. The curated default list covers a large and useful subset of the standard library (string manipulation, math, JSON parsing, path inspection, data structures, and so on) while excluding anything that writes to the filesystem, spawns processes, or modifies system state. You can extend the list for your own functions."

    "The mechanism behind safepyrun is [RestrictedPython](https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/), a long-standing project that compiles Python source code into a modified AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) where every attribute access, item access, and iteration is routed through hook functions. This means that when the LLM's code does `obj.method()`, it doesn't go directly to `method` -- it goes through a gatekeeper that checks whether that callable is on the allowlist. The same applies to `getattr`, `getitem`, and `iter`, so there's no easy way to accidentally reach a dangerous function through indirect access. safepyrun supplies these hook functions, wiring them up to an allowlist of permitted callables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a lot of modern Python code (and many LLM tool-calling frameworks) is async, safepyrun also depends on [restrictedpython-async](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/restrictedpython-async), which extends RestrictedPython to handle `await`, `async for`, and `async with` expressions."

   "source": [
    "A lot of the online discussion around RestrictedPython suggests it's not really useful for sandboxing, and that's true if you're trying to block a determined adversary. But an LLM is not a determined adversary. It's a well-meaning but occasionally clumsy collaborator. The threat model is completely different: you don't need to prevent deliberate escape attempts, you need to make it very unlikely that a hallucinated cleanup step or a misunderstood request causes damage. This is the same \"safe-ish\" philosophy used in [safecmd](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/safecmd) for bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you internalise this, the design space opens up. It's actually fine for the LLM to read files, access the internet via `httpx`, parse data, and call into your libraries. The things you want to prevent are writes to the filesystem, spawning processes, and overwriting important state. RestrictedPython gives us the mechanism to enforce this: it rewrites the AST to intercept attribute access, iteration, and item access, so that every callable goes through an allowlist check.\n",
    "\n",
    "The allowlist has three tiers. First, a curated subset of the standard library that has been audited once so every user doesn't have to repeat the work: things like `re`, `json`, `itertools`, `math`, `collections`, `pathlib` (read-only methods), and many more. Second, user-extended functions registered via `allow()`, so you can opt in your own project's functions and methods. Third, an LLM self-service mechanism: any symbol the LLM creates with a trailing underscore (like `helper_`) is automatically available in subsequent calls, letting it build up reusable utilities across a multi-step tool loop."
